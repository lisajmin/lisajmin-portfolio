title: Current Goals
---
My current job in the online ecommerce industry requires me to work with database systems and various selling platforms such as Amazon, Ebay, etc. While working in depth on these platforms, I was able to see the intricate structures and designs of the programming architecture. Gradually, a desire to create these systems formed. I hope to learn the full-stack developing skills required to build these sites along with the software engineering principles to create more dynamic, innovative applications. In addition, the coding community is a group of passionate, clever individuals and I would love to connect with other developers.
