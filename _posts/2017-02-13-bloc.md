title: Learning at Bloc
---
With heaps of coding schools popping up all over the country, it was difficult to discern which school to commit my time and effort. Bloc was the most appealing to me since the entire course is fully remote. I did not have to sacrifice my current job. Practically, it was not a luxury that I could afford. However, the question remained whether an online coding school would be equally as effective as an in-person coding school. The mentorship provided at Bloc bridges the educational benefit that in-person institutions provide as an advantage over online courses. 

I was fortunate to be paired with a informative, encouraging and current professional in the industry. Truly, without my mentor, it would have been more difficult for me to visualize the concepts. More importantly, my mentor has been able to share knowledge of the current working industry. This is the most important value in a mentorship and cannot be learned elsewhere. In addition, I sincerely appreciate that he was approachable. 

Overall, the course is well-designed, but intense. It was necessary for me to invest more time than the required hours for the course to become confident in the concepts. I may have needed extra studying since I do not have prior experience with coding. Regardless, you must invest the time and effort for the results. Wish me luck!
