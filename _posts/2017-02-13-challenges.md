title: Challenges as a Newbie
---
Coding was new to me. I have worked closely with a developer as a client, but I never needed to code. As a result, during the first few weeks of starting the road to becoming a developer, there was a frequent sensation of  brain cramps. The definition of concepts were studied and understood, but I just couldn't clearly see how all the concepts interacted with each other to build applications. I thought that advanced HTML and CSS was difficult until I reached Javascript. 

Javascript code can be hard to decipher. Multiple variables and complex data structures are intertwined and it was nearly impossible to keep track of the logic. Hence, the term 'spaghetti code'. Can you imagine trying to read through the logic of a pile of spaghetti? There were days when I would stare blankly at a page of code for an hour. However, an old-fashioned study method helped me with sorting through the logic. 

Cheap and easily accessible paper and pencil helped me significantly when I started to learn how to code. Physically writing the code was essential to help me focus and practice learning the proper syntax. In addition, I would sketch the data structures or write how the data would flow in the application. It may seem counterintuitive to use an archaic tool to learn how to use modern, upcoming technology, but it has worked for me!
